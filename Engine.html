<p>The GE90-115B of the 777-200LR/300ER already have a 42:1 overall pressure ratio and 23:1 HP compressor ratio.  Rolls-Royce Plc proposed its 132 in (337 cm) fan RB3025 concept with a 12:1 bypass ratio and 62:1 overall pressure ratio, targeting more than 10% better fuel burn over the GE90-115B and 15% over its Trent 800 powering the 777, with a composite fan and a core derived from the Trent 1000 with advanced HP materials.  Pratt & Whitney responded with a 100,000 lbf (440 kN) PW1000G architecture.  GE Aviation proposed the 128 in (325 cm) fan diameter GE9X with a 10:1 bypass ratio, a 60:1 overall pressure ratio and 27:1 HP compressor ratio for a 10% fuel burn improvement.
In March 2013, Boeing selected the GE9X with a 132 in (335 cm) fan at this time, its new core first run was in 2014, design was be frozen in 2015, the first engine was run in 2016 before flight testing in 2017 and certification in 2018. It will be the largest fan by GE. In the rest of 2013, thrust was bumped to 102,000 and 105,000 lbf (450 and 470 kN) to support the MTOW growing from 769,413 to 775,000 lb (349,000 to 351,534 kg) and increasing the payload-range, with even 108,000 lbf (480 kN) envisioned.<br><br> The engine is the size of the B737's cabin </p>

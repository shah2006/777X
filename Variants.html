<p>There are currently 2 models of the 777X in development: the 777X-8 and the 777X-9. However, there is a third model, the 777X-10. These are the differences.</p>
<h2>777X-8</h2>
<p>The 777-8 is a shortened derivative of the 777-9, 229 ft (69.8 m) long, between the 209 ft 1 in (63.7 m) 777-200 and 242 ft 4 in (73.9 m) 777-300. It will seat typically 365 passengers with a range of 8,690 nmi (16,090 km). It would succeed the ultra-long-range -200LR, and competes with the Airbus A350-1000. Production on the -8 will follow the -9 around two years later. It could be the basis of a freighter version which could be available 18 to 24 months after the -8 introduction.</p>
<h2>777X-9</h2>
<p>The 777-9 is a 9.4 ft (2.9 m) longer derivative of the 777-300ER for a 251 ft 9 in (76.7 m) length. It will seat typically 414 passengers over a range of 7,525 nmi (13,940 km). Boeing froze its design in August 2015 and should start first assembly in 2017, for an introduction in December 2019. Its operating empty weight grew from the 777-300ER's 373,500 to 400,000 lb (169,400 to 181,400 kg), just over, for the -9X target. The 777-9X should be longer than the previous longest airliner, the 250 ft 2 in (76.25 m) Boeing 747-8.</p>
<h2>777X-10</h2>
<p>Boeing is proposing to stretch the -9 by four rows of seats to accommodate 450 passengers in a 777-10X to compete with the Airbus A380 superjumbo. It has approached several airlines including Emirates, the largest operator of both the 777 and the A380. It will potentially be 263 feet (80 m) long, which is 12 ft more than the 777X-9</p>
